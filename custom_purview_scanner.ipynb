The removed topsoil will have to be replaced with clean, imported soil, and the entire\\n8,090 SF site re compacted to geotechnical engineer's specifications.\\nStructure was built on a raised foundation with crawlspace and attic.  Structure used conventional wood framing, cement Hardi\\nsiding, and a high profile, 30 year composition shingle roof.  The entire site was professionally landscaped and hard-scaped, and\\nused both traditional and drip irrigation.The following estimate is provided as an example of a line-item, Xactimate estimate that has been separated by coverage.

NVLAP \\n\\u2022 The Inspector is Cal/OSHA certified and conformed to procedures outlined in the EPA Building Inspector Course.\\u2022 Envirocheck personnel collected PCM air samples from each containment(s) following the completion of asbestos abatement of \\napproximately 238 square feet of drywall material (Note: The number of samples is ultimately left to the discretion of the on-site technician)\\u2022 The subject property is a two-story, single family residence approximately 1,832 total square feet and was built ~ 1959. Report Date: 10/24/2019Inspection Date: 10/23/2019\\nThis report presents the analytical results of the Limited Asbestos Air Clearance Survey performed on the subject property listed above by \\nEnvirocheck, Inc. Please read entire report prior to initiating any action. \\nLIMITATIONS\\nThe findings set forth in this report are strictly limited to the time, date and scope of the investigation. The results presented in this report are \\nbased on the analytical testing performed by the certified laboratory.  The results from the sampled locations are representative of the entire \\nhomogeneous material/areas and not just the locations sampled.  According to AHERA, 40 CFR, 763.87 (c)(1),(2) - A homogeneous area is \\nconsidered not to be Asbestos Containing Material (ACM) only when all required samples collected from a homogeneous area indicate levels \\nbelow regulated limits and a homogeneous area is considered ACM when at least one of the required samples collected indicates levels above \\nregulated limits.  This report does not guarantee that all inaccessible, hidden, or indistinguishable materials will be identified or sampled.  \\nSamples were limited to the materials and locations listed on the chain of custody.  Materials/areas that were not sampled shall be presumed to \\nbe asbestos containing until proven otherwise by appropriate sampling procedures.  Square footages are estimates only and should not be used \\nfor bidding purposes.\\nBACKGROUND, SAMPLING PROTOCOL AND TEST METHODS\\nThe purpose of this Limited Asbestos PCM Air Clearance Survey is as follows:\\n\\u2022 Envirocheck, Inc. was engaged by  to perform a limited asbestos air clearance survey at the above subject property.\\n\\u2022 CONTAINMENT 1 consists of dining roomFarmers Insurance\\n\\u2022 Each sample was analyzed using Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM) for fiber content.

To accomplish this, we have developed a standard set of protocols that encompass sample collection, handling, \\nanalysis, and reporting. Data quality is evaluated based on both inter-laboratory control and duplicate analysis. All PCM (Phase Contrast \\nMicroscopy) samples taken or received by Envirocheck, Inc. undergo proper chain-of-custody and log-in documentation. Quality is assured \\nby blind replicate analysis on 10% of all randomly selected samples. Microscopists analyze one reference slide per day, each with its own set \\nof control limits. Reference slide data is used to generate each analyst's Relative Standard Deviation (Sr), also known as the Coefficient of \\nVariation (CV). The Sr influences the 90% confidence interval, meaning the lower the Sr, the less variance from the mean reported asbestos \\nconcentration. Regular updates of Relative Standard Deviations (Sr) are produced for different categories of analysis: Intra-analyst, intra-\\nlaboratory, and inter-laboratory. Round robin samples are exchanged between a group of laboratories, with results evaluated by Technical and \\nQuality management.QUALITY ASSURANCEto be in excess of the Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 0.1 fibers per cubic centimeters.*Entrained fibers were not found to be in excess of the clearance criteria (0.01 fibers per cubic centimeters) as set by0.0027 f/cc 10/23/2019(Inside Containment)Comment\\nPassTable A.

NVLAP \\n• The Inspector is Cal/OSHA certified and conformed to procedures outlined in the EPA Building Inspector Course.• Envirocheck personnel collected PCM air samples from each containment(s) following the completion of asbestos abatement of \\napproximately 238 square feet of drywall material (Note: The number of samples is ultimately left to the discretion of the on-site technician)• The subject property is a two-story, single family residence approximately 1,832 total square feet and was built ~ 1959. Report Date: 10/24/2019Inspection Date: 10/23/2019\\nThis report presents the analytical results of the Limited Asbestos Air Clearance Survey performed on the subject property listed above by \\nEnvirocheck, Inc. Please read entire report prior to initiating any action. \\nLIMITATIONS\\nThe findings set forth in this report are strictly limited to the time, date and scope of the investigation. The results presented in this report are \\nbased on the analytical testing performed by the certified laboratory.  The results from the sampled locations are representative of the entire \\nhomogeneous material/areas and not just the locations sampled.  According to AHERA, 40 CFR, 763.87 (c)(1),(2) - A homogeneous area is \\nconsidered not to be Asbestos Containing Material (ACM) only when all required samples collected from a homogeneous area indicate levels \\nbelow regulated limits and a homogeneous area is considered ACM when at least one of the required samples collected indicates levels above \\nregulated limits.  This report does not guarantee that all inaccessible, hidden, or indistinguishable materials will be identified or sampled.  \\nSamples were limited to the materials and locations listed on the chain of custody.  Materials/areas that were not sampled shall be presumed to \\nbe asbestos containing until proven otherwise by appropriate sampling procedures.  Square footages are estimates only and should not be used \\nfor bidding purposes.\\nBACKGROUND, SAMPLING PROTOCOL AND TEST METHODS\\nThe purpose of this Limited Asbestos PCM Air Clearance Survey is as follows:\\n• Envirocheck, Inc. was engaged by  to perform a limited asbestos air clearance survey at the above subject property.\\n• CONTAINMENT 1 consists of dining roomFarmers Insurance\\n• Each sample was analyzed using Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM) for fiber content.

To accomplish this, we have developed a standard set of protocols that encompass sample collection, handling, \\nanalysis, and reporting. Data quality is evaluated based on both inter-laboratory control and duplicate analysis. All PCM (Phase Contrast \\nMicroscopy) samples taken or received by Envirocheck, Inc. undergo proper chain-of-custody and log-in documentation. Quality is assured \\nby blind replicate analysis on 10% of all randomly selected samples. Microscopists analyze one reference slide per day, each with its own set \\nof control limits. Reference slide data is used to generate each analyst's Relative Standard Deviation (Sr), also known as the Coefficient of \\nVariation (CV). The Sr influences the 90% confidence interval, meaning the lower the Sr, the less variance from the mean reported asbestos \\nconcentration. Regular updates of Relative Standard Deviations (Sr) are produced for different categories of analysis: Intra-analyst, intra-\\nlaboratory, and inter-laboratory. Round robin samples are exchanged between a group of laboratories, with results evaluated by Technical and \\nQuality management.QUALITY ASSURANCEto be in excess of the Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 0.1 fibers per cubic centimeters.*Entrained fibers were not found to be in excess of the clearance criteria (0.01 fibers per cubic centimeters) as set by0.0027 f/cc 10/23/2019(Inside Containment)Comment\\nPassTable A.
